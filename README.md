# Activity Tracker
##WIP, NOT FUNCTIONING YET

This project is to help me organize my activites and connections with people as I search for jobs.  Feel free to do whatever you want with this code, and I'm always open to suggestions.

### Usage

* Track To Do's on a day by day basis
* Create a history trail for contact with people

### For the Future

If this becomes super useful I might add more to it.

### Notes

This project was created on windows so you might have to convert CRLF to LF if you're working on it in Linux/Mac.
